# Implied Volatilities

Given an option pricing formula like the seminal one of _Black-Scholes-Merton (1973)_, implied volatilities are those volatility values that, when put into the formula, give observed market quotes for different option strikes and maturities.

In this case, the volatility is not an input parameter for the model/formula, but the result of a numerical optimization procedure given that formula.
