# Monte Carlo simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is one of the most important algorithms in finance and numerical science in general. Its importante stems from the fact that it is quite powerful when it coms to option pricing or risk management problems.

The downside is that is per se _computationally demanding_ and often needs huge amounts of memory even for quite simple problems. Therefore, it is necessary to implement Monte Carlo algorithms efficently.
